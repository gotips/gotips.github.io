You may have encountered a use case 🎯️ where you want to provide a set of flags to all Go applications. We end up providing all such flags to every go command ⬇️.

GOFLAGS environment variable to the rescue 💡️. The go command invokes the provided GOFLAGS before executing each command.

Official documentation as of writing this post -
